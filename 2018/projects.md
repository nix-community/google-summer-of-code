# Ideas for 2018 GSoC projects

The Nix project actually consists of several components that build on top of
each other. The list of idea's for the 2018 GSoC are organized by those
components:

- [Nix package manager & build DSL](#Nix)
- [Nixpkgs package collection](#Nixpkgs)
- [NixOS operating system](#NixOS)
- [NixOps (cloud) deployment system](#NixOps)
- [Other Projects](#other-projects)

## Nix
Nix is a DSL to describe builds and a package manager.

### Efficient binary deployments for e.g. IoT devices
Mentor: @moretea
Compute efficient diff between two (resurcive) derivations using a bsd-diff like algorithm, and
expand in-memory with low resoruces. Can be used to imporove update efficiiency for IoT like devices.

### langserver.org implementation for nix
mentor: @moretea

http://langserver.org/ - would solve a bunch of IDE problems, though
not indentation and syntax highlighting. Might be too complicated.

## Nixpkgs
Nixpkgs is a curated set of descriptions that describe how software packages
must be build, and specifiying all the required dependencies.

### Better support for documentation of library functions
mentor: @moretea

Library functions are only documented in the source code. Come up with some way to make them discoverable (via a function similar to `builtins.functionArgs`)

## NixOS
NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management.  Built on top of the
[Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix), it is completely declarative,
makes upgrading systems reliable, and has
[many other advantages](https://nixos.org/about.html).

## NixOps
mentor: @rbvermaa

NixOps is a tool for deploying sets of NixOS Linux machines, either to real
hardware or to virtual machines.  It extends NixOSâ€™s declarative approach to
system configuration management to networks and adds provisioning.


## Other Projects

### Documentation improvement project
mentor: @moretea

Currently, we have reference manuals, a wiki and blog posts scattered over the
internet. Other successfull open source projects provide tutorials and guides
to start learning the system, and to learn how to achieve certain objectives.
This projects would involve both writing the documentation, and given
the technical capabilities of nix, also add tests to make sure that the
documentation will not bit rot over time.

### Kubernetes CRI Interface
mentor: @moretea
Implement the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) which will enable Kubernetes to run Nix native containers,
without depending on other packaging formats such as Docker containers, that destroy the graph model of
dependencies offered by Nix.

## Abandoned project proposals
The follow idea's have not been picked up by a potential mentor yet.
You can still propose to target one of these projects, but be sure to
communicate with us to make sure that there will be a mentor available.

### Make the hnix nix interpreter work with nixpkgs.
We have a
[Nix interpreter written in Haskell](https://github.com/jwiegley/hnix)
but it can't currently build derivations. The idea is to make it fully nix compatible.

### Define and document API to nix-daemon

### Deterministic Builds

Nixpkgs has a great feature where every build is reproducible, which means that
if you and I both build a package from the repository with the same nixpkgs git
checkout, then we should be guaranteed to get the same package version, package
features, and the same closure of that package as well.

However, this does not ensure builds are deterministic. Deterministic builds are
reproducible all the way down to the binary, on disk-representation. For
example, consider the openssl package. While two users may be able to build the
same version, this doesn't ensure the binaries are exactly identical: openssl
embeds the current compilation date into the resulting binaries, meaning
compiling it today will result in a subtly different binary than what we get
tomorrow. This is one of the causes of indeterminism we often face.

Deterministic builds are incredibly powerful as a security feature, since any
two users should be able to always get the exact same binaries
independently. This opens the door to things like semi-untrusted build machines,
which we don't have to trust to ship us 'clean', un-backdoored binaries, and
makes sure we don't even have to trust Hydra to be secure.

The goal of deterministic builds is to root out these causes of indeterminism,
and get the Nixpkgs repository into a state where a significant portion of
binary builds are reproducible. For now, we're aiming for the system_tarball_pc
derivation, meaning everything up-to a full NixOS ISO should be reproducible,
bit-for-bit.

Much of the work for this project has already been done by Alexander
Kjeldaas. The goal is to get his work upstream into the official repository,
make sure it's part of the next NixOS stable release, and work further towards
expanding deterministic builds.

* **Scope of project**: The first step is merging the work of Alexander Kjeldass
  into the HEAD repository. Furthermore, as this should not take a significant
  amount of the 3 months of GSoC time, we should also expand this to have
  tooling support, in Hydra for example. For example, Debian's "Reproducible
  Builds" CI service simply reruns every build twice in order to weed out very
  obvious sources of build indeterminism (file ordering, CPU usage,
  psuedo-randomness, or timestamps). Extending Hydra to support this should be
  relatively simple, and can be enabled for example only on those packages
  marked with an deterministic = true;. Finally, we'll likely want to continue
  making as many packages as possible deterministic.
* **Required skills**: You should be quite familiar with how to create, patch,
  and develop Nix packages; strong Unix skills, and you'll probably want some
  Perl/C++ background to work on Hydra or Nix. familiarity with the basics of
  the Nixpkgs/NixOS manual are fine. Finally, it's possible in the process we'll
  need to work with upstreams or incorporate patches to our core utilities.

### Localization

Nix / NixOS / NixOps are getting a lot of attention, unfortunately all the
documentation which exists so far is in English. The purpose of this project is
to add infrastructure for localizing all the documentation of Nix, NixOS and
NixOps. Currently a large part of the documentation is in Docbook format, and
the rest is embedded in Nix expression files.

What should be done during this project is:

* Make tools to extract to language file for English
* Make the language file readable by Nix, such that all packages (Nixpkgs) meta
  attributes are localized, as well as all options descriptions (NixOS).
* Package tools for localizing Nix / NixOS.
* Document the process for localizing, and how to keep a local up-to-date.

At the end we should at least have a proof of concept in one locale, including
but not limited to:

* Localization of NixOS Introduction chapter.
* Localization of ~100 package descriptions.
* Localization of ~100 NixOS options.

### Peer-to-Peer substitutes

In general, Linux distributions have multiple mirrors to provide backup for
sources / binaries. Nix has a model which gives it the possibility to ask
trusted remote (or signed files from untrusted sources) about the hash of the
build output for one derivation (recipe), and then the binary can be downloaded
from any untrusted source. Being able to download a binary from any source
implies that we do not have to rely on mirrors for downloading the build
results, and that we can use decentralized ideas, such as P2P networks. Another
issue, inherent with this, is to ensure that we have anonymity among the persons
of such network. Not having anonymity implies that an attacker can use such
network to analyze if a server is vulnerable because it is using an outdated
version of bash / openssl.

A decentralized and anonymized P2P would help by:

* Making popular packages/versions persistent.
* Improve download speed, even from China (no need to "sneakernet").
* Reduce load from cache.nixos.org .

The goal of this project, is to create a new binary substitute based on a
decentralize and anonymized P2P, such as Tribler, which serve the content of the
nix store to other Nix users.

### Graphical and text-mode installers for NixOS

Currently, NixOS doesn't have any automatic, fancy installer. The goal would be
to create a minimal one, that does:

* Partition the hard drive
* Expose some basic configuration options from configuration.nix, things like
creating users and selecting desktop environments
    * Maybe a more advanced mode for selecting servers like OpenSSH
* Install NixOS via `nixos-install`

**Note**: it might be worth adapting existing code base of an already existent
installer to not reinvent partitioning

### Private files in the nix store

Currently, all files in the nix store are world-readable, which means that NixOS
configurations that need passwords or other credentials need to point to paths
outside of the store. It would be awesome if we could come up with a principled
way to fix this limitation.

Some discussion and existing work on the issue can be found at:
https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/8

### Multiple outputs infrastructure in nixpkgs

Nix has a feature known as "multiple outputs", where a single derivation can
produce multiple outputs which can be downloaded and garbage-collected
independently. So for example, glibc might have one output containing the
libraries and another containing the headers, and most users would only need the
libraries and would only need to download the headers when performing a
build. Judicious use of this feature could greatly reduce the size of closures
of various packages/the system configuration. Coming up with a good general way
for "normal-case" packages in nixpkgs to take advantage of this would be a great
benefit.

Note: This has already been partially done in the closure-size branch:
https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/7701

### Distributed nixops deployments

Currently NixOps state is all stored in a local sqlite database, so all
deployment has to be managed from one central machine. A good mechanism for
sharing that state would allow multiple users to manage the same deployments
from their own machines.


### Improve Nix and rewrite Perl scripts in C++

Currently Nix as a tool could use some improvement, there are many issues and
basic features that should be worked on:

* Getting rid of Perl dependency
* Inline docstring support
* Support for channel authentication (http simple authentication)
* Package query caching
* More user friendly and modern interface and output (with colors)
* Support for channel generation with one command
* Bindings for other languages
* More sane defaults

### Low-level improvements to nix performance

There may be some low-hanging fruit for improving performance of evaluation of
Nix expressions or Nix builds. Some ideas that might be worth exploring:

* Using lazy cons/nil lists instead of vectors for the list data type (and
  updating general list functions in the nixpkgs lib accordingly)
* Replacing .drv files, a potential IO bottleneck, with a purely in-memory
  representation of derivations
* Fix some instances of reading entire files into memory instead of streaming
* For the ambitious: multithreaded evaluation and/or building.

### Improve nix-build output for post-processing

When building (using nix-build), the standard out and error output are merged
and captured into build log files under /nix/var/log. Nix injects escape codes
to indicate actions but otherwise leaves things as-is.

It would be great if there was an out-of-band mechanism to indicate Nix
messages, standard output and standard error of a build. Build output is mostly
line-based, so one way would be to leave stdout untouched, and add `{E}` in
front of lines coming in from stderr, and `{N}` for nix-build messages. If a
stdout line begins with `{` it could be escaped with `{O}`. Some care can be
taken for builds that don't print newlines to e.g. indicate progress but have
interjections from stderr.

Another option is to prefix each line with the delta in milliseconds since the
last line of the stream, and mark stderr and nix outputs differently (e.g. "5 "
vs "E5 " vs "N5 ").

A logical next step would be to have nix-build not show output until an error
occurs, or to show a running tail of all builds, each in their own screen area.

One further refinement would be allowing the builder to output out-of-band
messages, to indicate the current build phase for example. This would come in as
a stderr line starting with e.g. `{N}phase:configurePhase`.

The overall goal would be to make building from source more approachable and
more amenable to debug.

### Improve Python support

Currently we have python 2.6 - 3.4 and PyPy support in Nix. Improving Python
support is an ongoing effort, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/1467

Main work would include:

* Add wheels support https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/329
* Improve documentation at http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#python
* Update PyPi2nix script for automated packaging https://github.com/garbas/pypi2nix

Other improvements would include:

* Add python modules support for python 3 and PyPy (like we have it for Python
  2.7)
* Split out usable functions for software having python bindings but not using
  distutils/setuptools

**Note**: talk to the mentor to set a goal of what improvements fit in 3 months.

### Improve support for other programming languages

(The same as Python above, for every major programming language in need of some
improvement, *mutatis mutandis*)

### Promote independence from systemd

Systemd is a hot, polemical, flamewar-prone topic. There is a lot of criticism
about it, mainly about being bloated and hard to maintain. And arguably systemd
goes against the underlying functional philosophy of NixOS. There is some
discussion on the mailing list about that:
http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2014-December/015361.html

The goal of that subject is to promote independence of systemd, and using some
sane default as s6 or even Gentoo's OpenRC suite.

### NixOS-kFreeBSD

Port Nix and Nixpkgs for other Unix-like open source systems would be a good
stress-test and also a way to popularize it. In a more ambitious goal, we can do
something as Gentoo and Debian already did, porting a whole system above FreeBSD
kernel.

### Build an Android distribution

Building a custom from for Android often involves sourcing opaque files from internet fora.
Nix would be an ideal system to describe how all these different sources should be combined
and compiled into an Android ROM.

### Hercules CI
Work on the (Haskell) implementation of [Hecules CI](https://github.com/hercules-ci/hercules)

### Home Manager improvements
[Home manager](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) appears to be one of the most commonly used ways to
have a declarative user profile. 
Options are to add extra programs and configuration settings, but it might be interesting to offer
a `home-shell` that in functionality is similar to nix-shell, but extends the scope to include settings
for programs (such as XDG). Other settings (like .vim) could be managed via bind namespaces and
overlay file systems.

### Distributed binary cache
mentor: @moretea
Required part of a different approach to a distributed build system for Nix.

This distributed binary cache will run as a set of daemons on build nodes.
A distributed database (e.g. etcd) is used to keep track of which nodes has build which derivations.
A local http server, acting as a binary cache endpoint, will query the distributed database to find out
which other build nodes have this file availble, and fetch it from one of those machines.

### "Distributed" build system suitable to be run as e.g. GitLab runners.
Glue code that together with the project described in 'Distributed binary cache', results in a build system that can be integrated into external tools like GitLab, GitHub and BitBucket.

### Implement merge queue for 'evergreen' master
Merge queues offer two benefits:
- Master will allways build and be availble.
- Automatic batching of PR's to reduce total required build time (by not having to run all tests)
