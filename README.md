# GSoC projects

This repo is used to coordinate efforts around the [Google Summer of Code][1] (GSoC) program in the Nix community.

GSoC is a program that sponsors students to work on Open Source projects in the summer. A lot of students have to do summer jobs to sustain their living. Instead of that, why not exercise your skills for 3 months while getting paid?
